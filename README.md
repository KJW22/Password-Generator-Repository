# Password-Generator-Repository
# Project Title: Password Generator

Summary: This project features a password generator that randomly generates a password based on preselected criteria. These criteria are a password length between 8 and 128 characters and a selection of uppercase, lowercase, number, and/or special characters.  

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Javascript and visual studio code must be preinstalled. Also must have GitHub account.

```


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

Deploy file from live site.
Rvar ucl = confirm ("use capital letters? Type y or n.");
  If (ucl === "yes"); {console.log("UpperCase=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")};
  If (ucl === "no"); {console.log("UpperCase=undefined")};
  
  var ulc = confirm ("use lowercase letters? Type y or n.");
  If (ulc === "yes"); {console.log("lowerCase=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")};
  If (ulc === "no"); {console.log("lowerCase=undefined")};
  
  var un = confirm ("use numbers? Type y or n.");
  If (un === "yes"); {console.log("number=0123456789")};
  If (un === "no"); {console.log("number=undefined")};
  
  var usc = confirm ("use special characters? Type y or n.");
  If (usc === "yes"); {console.log("specialCharacter=#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~")};
  If (usc === "no"); {console.log("specialCharacter=undefined")};
